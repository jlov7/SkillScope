# Security Policy

SkillScope is an R&D repository maintained by an individual practitioner. There is no commercial service or dedicated support channel attached to the project.

If you notice a security concern in the sample code:

1. [Open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/skillscope/skillscope/issues/new/choose) with clear reproduction steps and affected files.
2. Mark the issue as “Security” or “Private” if you would like maintainers to review before public disclosure.
3. Please allow at least 14 days for triage; this project is maintained in personal spare time.

Sample commands in this repository do not perform outbound network access unless you explicitly configure API keys or exporter endpoints. The `ops/` stack runs entirely on localhost.

Thanks for helping keep the ecosystem safe for researchers.
