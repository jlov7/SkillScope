# Security Policy

SkillScope is a research project and does not operate production infrastructure. If you discover a potential vulnerability or security concern, please:

1. Email a detailed report to security@skillscope.dev (or open a private issue with maintainers).
2. Include steps to reproduce, affected versions, and any mitigation ideas.
3. Allow at least 14 days for investigation before public disclosure.

Sample commands in this repository do not perform outbound network access unless you explicitly configure API keys or exporter endpoints. The `ops/` stack runs entirely on localhost.

Thank you for helping keep the ecosystem safe.
